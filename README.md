### REST: A Restful Web Service <a name="rest--a-restful-web-service"></a> 
In this project, students will explore RESTful Design by implement a RESTful web service that also makes RESTful requests to external APIs.  
### Map-Reduce: Word Counting <a name="map-reduce--word-counting"></a>
In this projects, students will explore distributed computing programming by using the Map Reduce framework to implement their own word count.
