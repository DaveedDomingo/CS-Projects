## Distributed Computing Projects 

<a name="rpc--the-bulletin-board-web-service"></a>
### RPC: The Bulletin Board Web Service
In this projects, students will explore Remote Procedure Calls using the modern framework of gRPC and Google Protocol Buffers.

<a name="rest--a-restful-web-service"></a> 
### REST: A Foodie Web Service 
In this project, students will explore RESTful Design by implement a RESTful web service that also makes RESTful requests to external APIs.

<a name="map-reduce--word-counting"></a>
### Map-Reduce: Processing Reddit Data
In this project, students will explore distributed computing programming by using the Map Reduce framework to perform data processing on real Reddit Data in a distributed manner.

## Computer Security Projects

<a name="cracking-sub-cipher"></a>
### Crypto: Cracking Simple Substitution Ciphers
In this project, students will explore the complexity of simple substitution ciphers and try and come up with programs that can automatically break them using brute force/frequency analysis.
