## Distributed Computing Projects <a name="distributed-computing-projects"></a>
### RPC: The Bulletin Board Web Service <a name="rpc--the-bulletin-board-web-service"></a>
In this projects, students will explore Remote Procedure Calls using the modern framework of gRPC and Google Protocol Buffers.

### REST: A Foodie Web Service <a name="rest--a-restful-web-service"></a> 
In this project, students will explore RESTful Design by implement a RESTful web service that also makes RESTful requests to external APIs.

### Map-Reduce: Processing Reddit Data <a name="map-reduce--word-counting"></a>
In this project, students will explore distributed computing programming by using the Map Reduce framework to perform data processing on real Reddit Data in a distributed manner.

## Computer Security Projects <a name="computer-security-projects"></a>
### Crypto: Cracking Simple Substitution Ciphers <a name="cracking-sub-cipher"></a>
In this project, students will explore the complexity of simple substitution ciphers and try and come up with programs that can automatically break them using brute force/frequency analysis.
