## Operating Systems Projects 

<a name="os-overhead--system-calls-and-signals"></a>
### OS Overhead: System Calls and Signals
In this assignment, students will explore the cost of context switching and OS invocation by timing System Calls and Signal Handling.

<a name="cpu-virtualization-threads-and-scheduler"></a>
### CPU Virtualization: User Level Threads and Scheduler
In this assignments students will explore CPU virutalization by implementing their own user-level threading library and scheduler.

## Distributed Computing Projects 

<a name="rpc--the-bulletin-board-web-service"></a>
### RPC: The Bulletin Board Web Service
In this projects, students will explore Remote Procedure Calls using the modern framework of gRPC and Google Protocol Buffers.

Project Link: https://github.com/DaveedDomingo/GRPC-Bulletin-Board-Project

<a name="rest--a-restful-web-service"></a> 
### REST: A Foodie Web Service 
In this project, students will explore RESTful Design by implement a RESTful web service that also makes RESTful requests to external APIs.  

Project Link: https://github.com/DaveedDomingo/Foodie-Web-Service-Project

<a name="map-reduce--word-counting"></a>
### Map-Reduce: Processing Reddit Data
In this project, students will explore distributed computing programming by using the Map Reduce framework to perform data processing on real Reddit Data in a distributed manner.

<a name="computer-security-projects"></a>
## Computer Security Projects

<a name="cracking-sub-cipher"></a>
### Crypto: Cracking Simple Substitution Ciphers
In this project, students will explore the complexity of simple substitution ciphers and try and come up with programs that can automatically break them using brute force/frequency analysis.

<a name="encrypt-files-java"></a>
### Encryption: Encrypting Files with Java
In this assignment, students will explore how to encrypt and decrypt files in Java using public-key cryptography and symmetric key cryptography to carry out secure file sharing.
